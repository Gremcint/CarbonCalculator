# CarbonCalculator
This is my masters thesis project. This software was developed to be a proof of concept software package for calculating carbon credits for projects for the UNFCCC using the methodolgies here: https://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/index.html My thesis is available here: http://digitalcollections.trentu.ca/objects/etd-919 Chapter 4 provides a detailed overview of the different modules of the software. This is not a finished software package and lacks the polish and error checking that would go into a final product, it was developed as mentioned a proof of concept.
