# CarbonCalculator
This is my masters thesis project. This software was developed to be a proof of concept software package for calculating carbon credits for projects for the UNFCCC using the methodolgies here: https://cdm.unfccc.int/methodologies/index.html My thesis is available here: http://digitalcollections.trentu.ca/objects/etd-919 Chapter 4 provides a detailed overview of the different modules of the software. This is not a finished software package and lacks the polish and error checking that would go into a final product, it was developed as mentioned a proof of concept. 

Each carbon project requires a H2 database file and an XML file. You can create those using the main menu and then create a project. After that you can then create tables and begin entering equations and exploring the other features. I am putting this up as a portfolio project, I would highlight the equation builder for the amount of work I put into creating a GUI for entering equations and the MathHandling class that processes the equations. The thesis provides more detailed descriptions of how the math is calculated in Chapter 3 and the language used to store the equations in the appendixes.
